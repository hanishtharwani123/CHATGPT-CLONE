![Web capture_14-12-2023_151823_localhost](https://github.com/cumbersomeamir/chat-interface-hanish/assets/104623869/2738192a-ee38-4089-b454-4130cac97f95)

## Overview

This project is a Chat Interface that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language processing. It allows users to input prompts and receive responses generated by the AI model.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React (with Vite)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- OpenAI API for natural language processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-interface.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd chat-interface/client
   npm install

   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following content:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-uri
   ```

   Replace `your-openai-api-key` and `your-mongodb-connection-uri` with your actual OpenAI API key and MongoDB connection URI.

4. Install the OpenAI library:

   ```bash
   npm install openai@^4.0.0
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   # In the client directory
   cd chat-interface/client
   npm run dev

   # In the server directory
   cd chat-interface/server
   npm start
   ```

6. Open the application in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## API Endpoints

- **GET /getData**: Retrieve chat data from the MongoDB database.
- **POST /prompt**: Submit a user prompt, process it with OpenAI, and store the conversation data.

## Data Schema

The MongoDB schema for storing chat data:

```json
{
  "predictions": {
    "conversations": [
      {
        "session_id": "unique_session_id",
        "timestamp_start": "2023-10-18T12:00:00Z",
        "timestamp_end": "2023-10-18T12:20:00Z",
        "exchanges": [
          {
            "user_input": "Tell me a joke.",
            "ai_output": "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!",
            "timestamp": "2023-10-18T12:01:00Z"
          },
        ]
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Access the web application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. Enter a prompt in the input field and submit to receive AI-generated responses.

## Using OpenAI Library

To use the OpenAI library, include the following code snippet in your application:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    stream: true,
  });

  for await (const chunk of completion) {
    console.log(chunk.choices[0].delta.content);
  }
}

main();
```
